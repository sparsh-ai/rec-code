## Notes
### Definition
At their core, recommendation systems are nothing but similarity hunters. Depending on how you define "similarity" between two "items", you can a range of applications for these systems. Given any reasonable similarity function between items, a recommender system presents relevant items to a user. This similarity function between 2 items could be common users that have interacted with those items in the past, similarity in their attributes, similarity in context in which they are used, and so on.
